# Stripe Integration Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions to complete the Stripe payment integration for your AI Animation Image application.

## 1. Database Migration

First, run the SQL migration to add payment tracking fields:

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration script from `/migrations/add_payment_tracking_fields.sql`:

```sql
-- Add payment tracking fields to images_state table
ALTER TABLE images_state 
ADD COLUMN payment_intent_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN payment_amount INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN purchased_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Add index on payment_intent_id for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_images_state_payment_intent_id ON images_state(payment_intent_id);

-- Add index on payment_status for filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_images_state_payment_status ON images_state(payment_status);
```

## 2. Create Stripe Product and Price

1. **Login to Stripe Dashboard**: Go to [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

2. **Create a Product**:
   - Navigate to **Products** in your Stripe Dashboard
   - Click **"Add product"**
   - Fill in product details:
     - Name: "AI Animation Image"
     - Description: "Professional AI-generated animation images"
   - Configure the price:
     - Type: "One time"
     - Amount: $2.99
     - Currency: USD
   - Click **"Save product"**

3. **Copy the Price ID**:
   - After creating the product, you'll see a Price ID (format: `price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - Copy this Price ID for the next step

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with the following values:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Stripe Price ID from step 2
STRIPE_ANIMATION_IMAGE_SINGLE_PRICE_ID=price_your_actual_price_id_here

# Replace with your actual webhook secret from step 4
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret_here
```

## 4. Set Up Stripe Webhooks

1. **Create Webhook Endpoint**:
   - In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks**
   - Click **"Add endpoint"**
   - Endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events to send:
     - `payment_intent.succeeded`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - Click **"Add endpoint"**

2. **Get Webhook Secret**:
   - Click on your newly created webhook
   - In the "Signing secret" section, click **"Reveal"**
   - Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
   - Add it to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## 5. Test the Integration

### Test in Development Mode

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Use Stripe Test Cards**:
   - **Successful payment**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Payment requires authentication**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
   - **Payment is declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - Use any future expiry date, any CVC, and any postal code

3. **Test the complete flow**:
   - Upload an image
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Navigate to the paywall page
   - Click "Pay Securely with Card"
   - Enter test card details
   - Verify successful payment and redirect to download page

### Test Webhooks Locally

1. **Install Stripe CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # Or download from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
   ```

2. **Login to Stripe CLI**:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Forward webhooks to your local server**:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

4. **Copy the webhook signing secret** displayed in the terminal and update your `.env` file

## 6. Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Update `STRIPE_ANIMATION_IMAGE_SINGLE_PRICE_ID` with production price ID
- [ ] Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with production webhook secret
- [ ] Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` uses live keys (starts with `pk_live_`)
- [ ] Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` uses live keys (starts with `sk_live_`)

### Stripe Dashboard Configuration
- [ ] Create production product and price
- [ ] Set up production webhook endpoint with your live domain
- [ ] Test with real payment methods (small amounts)
- [ ] Configure Stripe account settings (business details, bank account, etc.)

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Webhook endpoint is using HTTPS
- [ ] All environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Test webhook signature verification
- [ ] Monitor Stripe Dashboard for any errors or failed payments

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for failed payments
- Check webhook delivery status in Stripe Dashboard
- Monitor application logs for payment-related errors
- Review successful payment notifications

### Error Handling
- Failed payments are logged in Stripe Dashboard
- Webhook failures are retried automatically by Stripe
- Application errors are logged to console (configure proper logging in production)

## 8. Common Issues and Solutions

### Payment Intent Creation Fails
- **Issue**: "Price not found" error
- **Solution**: Verify `STRIPE_ANIMATION_IMAGE_SINGLE_PRICE_ID` is correct and active

### Webhooks Not Working
- **Issue**: Payments succeed but images aren't unlocked
- **Solution**: Check webhook endpoint URL and signing secret

### Payment Form Not Loading
- **Issue**: Stripe Elements not appearing
- **Solution**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is correct

### Database Errors
- **Issue**: Payment tracking fields not found
- **Solution**: Ensure database migration was run successfully

4. Set up automated monitoring and alerting for payment failures

Your Stripe integration is now complete and ready for production use!
