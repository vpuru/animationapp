Task: Stylize the entire source photo into a Studio Ghibli–inspired, hand-drawn animation while PRESERVING the original composition.

Source constraints (highest priority):
- Keep the original framing, aspect ratio, and camera orientation. Do not recrop or switch to portrait if the source is not portrait.
- Preserve subject count and relative sizes. Include all visible people from the source; do not remove or invent people.
- Maintain poses and facing direction. If any subject is back-facing or partially occluded, keep it that way—do NOT rotate to show faces.
- Keep subject placement and occlusions as in the source (left/right ordering, overlap, distance).
- If a subject is close to the edge, extend background subtly rather than cropping anyone out.

Style (apply without changing composition):
- Studio Ghibli–inspired, clean line art and 2–3 tone cel shading; pastel palette, warm ambient light; soft painterly, low-detail background.
- Outer contour slightly thicker than interior lines; very light blush on cheeks if a face is visible; no photoreal textures.

Identity/face rules (only when a face is actually visible):
- Preserve identity cues: face shape, eye spacing/gaze, nose/mouth position, hairline/hairstyle.
- Eyes: almond-shaped, single dark outline; flat-color irises with one highlight; no extra pupils/eyelids.
- Eyebrows: single clear stroke matching natural thickness.
- Nose: minimal mark (tiny “L” or dot); no photoreal shading.
- Mouth: small, tidy anime-style (single clean outline with subtle fill 5–10% darker than skin). If smiling/open: bean shape with one interior shadow; teeth as one white band.
- Ears align with eye level.
- Keep shading to 2–3 cel tones; edges crisp, no double lines, smearing, or blur.

Negative instructions:
- Do NOT reframe to a single-person portrait. Do NOT crop out any person. Do NOT change orientation or zoom. No symmetry forcing that alters likeness.
